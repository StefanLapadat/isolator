There's starting to be somewhat a lot of stuff that I do not support. 

Do not support nice correct merging of polygons; We could fix this if we somehow incorporate clipper cpp lib into wasm.. And if we also incorporate fyrox engine instead of babylon, it's gonna be wonderfull!! :D 

And now also do not support tiles with funky base and surface polygons. 
We don't have (and will not have for now) great treatment of corners when it comes to 

This will have to be fixed in future. And it's quite important to be fixed because otherwise, we are not gonna have probems triangulating tile surfaces. For now I think it's gonna work out, but generally, I am going to have to implement all these things if I intend to have a serious program.
